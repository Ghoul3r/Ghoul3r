Machorius is a 14 year old self-taught game dev and programmer from a village in Croatia. He lives in the U.S.A. with his family. He was introduced to programming and engineering at an early age. When he was a toddler he loved cardboard boxes. Everytime his parents would get a shipment they would know to give it to him. He would make quite elaborate vending machines and different contraptions that were so detailed you wouldn't dream a 4 year old would be able to make it. He then started using Scratch and was quickly able to make fully fledged games and programs in the software. He even made his mom a birthday card through it. When they would teach programming to the other kids at school he would help as he knew most of what was being taught. He then dropped his passion for coding and building and started finding little side hobbies. However, on YouTube he stumbled upon a Brackeys video and quickly wanted to create games of his own. He started using unity and created his first ever game for a 5th grade project. He then dropped it again for another 2 years and returned to it during the middle of his 7th grade school year. He then made countless nameless projects and fine tuned his coding skills. He is now fluent in 4 different programming languages. If you have any questions, you can use the issues tab on any project and he is quick to answer them. Pull requests are always welcome.
